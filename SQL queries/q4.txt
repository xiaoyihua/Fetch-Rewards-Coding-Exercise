When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

# Calculate total number for accepted
SELECT SUM(i.quantity_purchased) AS total_items_accepted
FROM Receipts r
JOIN Items i ON r.receipt_id = i.receipt_id
WHERE r.rewardsReceiptStatus = 'ACCEPTED';

    
# Calculate total number for ‘Rejected’
SELECT SUM(i.quantity_purchased) AS total_items_rejected
FROM Receipts r
JOIN Items i ON r.receipt_id = i.receipt_id
WHERE r.rewardsReceiptStatus = 'REJECTED';
