When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

# Calculate avg spend of accepted
SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS average_spend_accepted
FROM Receipts
WHERE receipt_status = 'Accepted';

# Calculate avg spend of REJECTED
SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS average_spend_rejected
FROM Receipts
WHERE reciept_stats = 'Rejected';
